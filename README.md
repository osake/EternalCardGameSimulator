# EternalCardGameSimulator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/osake/EternalCardGameSimulator.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/osake/EternalCardGameSimulator)


This is my simulator for Eternal Card Game which is built using sbt.  For the Mac, using brew:

```
brew install sbt
```

The simulator's runner can accept a number of time to execute the simulator.  For example,
running the simulator 10 times:

```
sbt "run 10"
```

Use `sbt test` to execute the test suite.

I originally wrote this using Ruby, but decided to plunk around with Scala, so this is the rewrite.
It is currently unfinished, but gives anyone interested a starting point.
