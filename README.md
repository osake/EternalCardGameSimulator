# EternalCardGameSimulator


This is my simulator for Eternal Card Game which is built using sbt.  For the Mac, using brew:

```
brew install sbt
```

Use sbt to run/test, etc.

I originally wrote this using Ruby, but decided to plunk around with Scala, so this is the rewrite.
It is currently unfinished, but gives anyone interested a starting point.
